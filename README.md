## About

This project is based on [Grant Sanderson](https://github.com/3b1b)'s video and paper about calulating the PI by counting the perfectly elastic collisions:

- https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/clacks-solution

The project itself is implemented using Wolfram Mathematica Language, with additional use of FFmpeg codec. In order to setup the project you should install FFmpeg first. 

We provides presentation based on paper mentioned above, but it is really a simplified version translated to polish, so you shouldn't really relay on it instead just read Grant's paper.
